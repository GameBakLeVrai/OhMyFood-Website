# OhMyFood-Website
Creation and revitalization of a restaurant website using animations.

## Background of Project

- Your mission is to develop a "mobile first" site listing the menus of gourmet restaurants. In addition to traditional reservation systems, customers will be able to compose the menu for their meal so that the dishes are ready when they arrive. No more waiting in restaurants!

    The sales team has already managed to convince 4 restaurateurs to use the OhMyFood platform. Paul decided that the site would initially contain 4 menus.
